BulkLn
================

`ln` alternative in case you think `ln` in a shell loop takes too much time to
create many links.


## How to build / install

Classic way:

```sh
curl -sSL http://git.hiddenalpha.ch/bulk-ln.git/snapshot/bulk-ln-master.tar.gz | tar xz
cd bulk-ln-master
./configure
make
make install
```

In case you prefer more sustainable build environments,
"./contrib/build-env-setup/README.md"
potentially is interesting for you.
